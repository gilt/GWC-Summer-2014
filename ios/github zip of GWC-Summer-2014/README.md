Summer 2014 project for the Girls Who Code program

Our app aggregates various online clothing retail sites, allowing users to browse fluidly through their favorite stores and assemble wishlists of products. Other functionalities will include sorting and searching tools.

Our program obtains product information by scraping websites with a Python program called BeautifulSoup, and then stores that data in a preliminary dictionary. The mobile app is a native iOS app written in Objective-C, which runs independently of the scraping program.
